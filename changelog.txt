v0.25:
Telnet: More IAC functionality (LINEMODE, TERM_SPEED, SEND_LOCATION, ENVIROMENT_OP, SUPRESS_GO_AHEAD) and enabled the previously disabled echo settings.
Telnet: LINEMODE EDIT setting now controls whether to send bytes in bulk (allowing for local editing) or byte-by-byte to remote server.
Telnet: Fixes to IAC NAWS - Now takes into account column settings (based on font size for now instead of actual 40/80 column setting) and row settings (29 for PAL and 27 for NTSC -- 1 row is always used for status bar at the top).
PC Side: smdt-pc to replace socat has been created, capable of piping and logging Tx/Rx streams.
IRC: Initial IRC support (Line parser/command interpreter).
IRC: mIRC colour support.
IRC: CTCP Support (Version and ping only).
Terminal: Testing 256 column mode for 4x8 fonts and added left/right scrolling for 4x8 fonts.
Terminal: Rewritten MoveCursor function since it was old and buggy.
Terminal: Emulator scrolling bugfixes.
PS2KB: Moved out telnet state specific code.
PS2KB: Rewritten scancode handler, now half the code size and supports all keys/combinations and keyboard layouts (US only for now) - Still TODO: CapsLock/NumLock/ScrollLock handling is not implemented.
A million tiny little tweaks here and there.
