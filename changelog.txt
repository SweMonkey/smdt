v0.27:
SRAM: Added the ability to save config to SRAM.
IRC: Added "tabs" to have several channels/private messaging going at once. It uses 8-bit tilemap buffers in RAM, 
it is limited to 3 concurrent "tabs" at once due to RAM requirements (3*8KB = 24KB RAM used). Use F1/F2/F3 to change tab.
IRC: Added a typing input at the bottom of the screen.
IRC: Commands implemented, prefixed with '/'. Use '/raw <IRC COMMAND>' to send raw IRC command strings.
IRC: You can now initiate a private conversation.
IRC: User list added, press F5 to show/hide window
IRC: Can now change username via the /nick <your_nick> command.
Telnet: Added a proper bell... ok PSG beeps.
Terminal: Added the terminal emulator as its own launchable session type.
TRM: Some windowing cleanup. (TRM = Window plane UI backend)
NET: Moved Networking stuff out of the terminal emulator (Rx/Tx etc) into a new unit 'NET'.
PS2KB: Added timeout code when in the middle of reading a bitstream. May cause dropped key input when the MD is very busy with network traffic. This blocking bug has existed at least since v0.20.
PS2KB: Added Swedish keyboard layout.
Fixed some tables that was supposed to be in ROM but instead got placed in RAM (type const * const varname)
Various bugfixes, most related to mIRC colour fuckery.

v0.26:
DevMgr: Device manager created. Devices can now be mapped to pin 1+2 or pin 3+4 on any port. 2 PS/2 devices can be on the same port as a UART device.
DevMgr: Serial/UART device can be in any port now (not recommended to change port while tx/rx is ongoing).
DevMgr: Added a temporary crude device detection system. Joypad will be enabled on port 1 only when no keyboard is detected or when keyboard is not in port 1.
PS2KB: Initial HOST->PS/2 communication (PS/2 response is always "rx fail, please resend command" though).
Quickmenu: Some updates regarding device list and selecting UART port.
Quickmenu: Text colour is selectable when using 4x8 font.
Telnet: Added some missing escape codes (skeleton code mostly).
Terminal and telnet: A few tweaks related to scrolling, cursor handling and special characters.
Terminal: Blinky cursor is back. It used to cause lockups, lets hope it doesn't anymore.
More UTF8 "characters" added.

v0.25:
Telnet: More IAC functionality (LINEMODE, TERM_SPEED, SEND_LOCATION, ENVIROMENT_OP, SUPRESS_GO_AHEAD) and enabled the previously disabled echo settings.
Telnet: LINEMODE EDIT setting now controls whether to send bytes in bulk (allowing for local editing) or byte-by-byte to remote server.
Telnet: Fixes to IAC NAWS - Now takes into account column settings (based on font size for now instead of actual 40/80 column setting) and row settings (29 for PAL and 27 for NTSC -- 1 row is always used for status bar at the top).
PC Side: smdt-pc to replace socat has been created, capable of piping and logging Tx/Rx streams.
IRC: Initial IRC support (Line parser/command interpreter).
IRC: mIRC colour support.
IRC: CTCP Support (Version and ping only).
Terminal: Testing 256 column mode for 4x8 fonts and added left/right scrolling for 4x8 fonts.
Terminal: Rewritten MoveCursor function since it was old and buggy.
Terminal: Emulator scrolling bugfixes.
PS2KB: Moved out telnet state specific code.
PS2KB: Rewritten scancode handler, now half the code size and supports all keys/combinations and keyboard layouts (US only for now) - Still TODO: CapsLock/NumLock/ScrollLock handling is not implemented.
A million tiny little tweaks here and there.

v0.24:
Split terminal and telnet client apart (to prepare for other protocols).
Implemented input subsystem.
Changed KB/JP to new input subsystem.
Implemented statemachine (to prepare for other protocols).
Added a startup menu.
Initial IRC state.

v0.23:
Lowered keyboard polling timeout, it caused the text to be printed out in chunks (not very smooth looking).
Detecting (and ignoring) UTF BOM.
Made status icons more attractive.
Added sent/received bytes statistics.
Added hex viewer for RX Buffer.

v0.22 - 2023-11-11:
Added a quick and dirty antialiased 4x8 font.
Added a circular buffer for incoming bytes.
Fixed cursor going rogue when switching between font sizes.

v0.21 - 2023-11-10:
Added support for 4x8 font (thanks to RKT).

v0.21 - 2023-11-09:
Added baud speed selector (300, 1200, 2400, 4800).


--- Older changes ---

v0.1x-0.20 - 2023-xx-xx:
Implemented IAC code sequence handling.
Implemented basic UTF-8 decoding.
Rewritten escape code sequence handling.
Rewritten line clearing and character printing functions.
Implemented a menu system for changing terminal settings.
Fixed shift key on keyboard not actually shifting letters.
Added terminal type selector (XTerm, ANSI, VT100, MEGADRIVE and UNKNOWN).
